# System Layouts
In this repository, I want to put into practice my knowledge of HTML, CSS, and (not much) Javascript to build some layouts with a focus on systems.

# How to run

First, go to the app folder "system-layout"

```

cd system-layouts

```

Then, install dependencies.

```

yarn

```

Next, run the server.

```

yarn run dev

```
# CSS

In the work with TailwindCSS is important to have it intsalled in the yarn, and watch all the changes.

```bash
npx tailwindcss -i ./src/style.css -o ./src/output.css --watch
```
